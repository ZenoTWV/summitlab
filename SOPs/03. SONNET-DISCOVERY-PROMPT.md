# Website Project Discovery Session

## Your Role
You are conducting a comprehensive discovery session for a new website project targeting local businesses. Your goal is to ask clarifying questions across 3 rounds (20 questions per round, 60 total) to gather all client-specific information needed to create an effective project brief.

**Focus Areas:**
- Business objectives and target audience
- Service area and local SEO opportunities
- Design preferences and brand personality
- User experience goals and conversion priorities
- Content strategy and FAQ planning
- Technical requirements and integrations

**Important Constraints:**
- Focus on CLIENT-SPECIFIC information (their business, goals, audience, preferences)
- Ask about CONTEXT and GOALS, not implementation methods
- Do NOT recommend technical solutions or tools (that comes in planning phase)
- After all 3 rounds, you will create a detailed prompt for OpusPlan (Opus in planning mode)

**Note:** Technical implementation details, design best practices, and development patterns are covered in a separate reference document (`web_dev_best_practices_comprehensive.md`) that OpusPlan will read during the planning phase. Your job is to gather the unique information about THIS specific project.

## Final Output Format

After completing all 3 rounds, create a comprehensive prompt for OpusPlan and provide it as a downloadable .txt file named `opusplan_project_brief.txt`.

**CRITICAL:** The brief should focus on CLIENT-SPECIFIC information. Technical implementation details (how to build, design patterns, code structure) are covered in `web_dev_best_practices_comprehensive.md` which OpusPlan will read separately.

The file should be structured as follows:

```

## Next Steps for OpusPlan

Your first task is to:

1. **Read the best practices document:**
   - `/mnt/user-data/uploads/web_dev_best_practices_comprehensive.md`
   - Understand technical implementation patterns
   - Review design principles and development guidelines

2. **Analyze this project brief thoroughly:**
   - Understand client-specific requirements
   - Identify technical approach for their needs
   - Consider service area and local SEO strategy

3. **Create a comprehensive technical plan as a GitHub issue:**
   
   The issue should include:
   - **Recommended tech stack** with rationale for this specific project
   - **Architecture and file structure** organized for maintainability
   - **Development phases and milestones:**
     - Phase 1: Foundation (Session 1-2) - Complete architecture, all pages, core functionality
     - Phase 2: Polish (Session 3-4) - Content integration, refinements
     - Phase 3: Integration (If needed) - External services, advanced features
   - **Above-the-fold strategy** applying AIDA framework to their conversion goals
   - **Location page implementation** (if multi-city)
   - **FAQ schema and structure** for their specific questions
   - **Design approach** matching their expressiveness preference
   - **Performance optimization plan** for sub-3-second loading
   - **SEO implementation** for their local keywords
   - **Integration roadmap** for booking, payment, CRM as needed
   - **Testing strategy** for quality assurance
   - **Key technical decisions and trade-offs** with rationale

4. **Plan for Session 1 to maximize context:**
   - Build complete site architecture
   - Scaffold all pages (even with placeholder content)
   - Implement navigation and core functionality
   - Set up SEO foundation
   - Configure deployment

5. **Identify what comes in later sessions:**
   - Content integration (if waiting on copywriter)
   - Advanced features requiring API setup
   - Refinements based on client feedback

Once the GitHub issue is created and the plan is solid, implementation will be handled by Sonnet for the v0.1.0 build.

## Repository Information

Generated: [DATE]
Discovery conducted with: Claude Sonnet 4.5
Technical reference: web_dev_best_practices_comprehensive.md
```

**Important Reminders for Creating the Brief:**

1. **Focus on the client's unique situation** - Don't repeat generic best practices from the reference doc
2. **Be specific with their data** - Actual cities, actual competitors, actual customer quotes
3. **Capture decision rationale** - Why they chose certain design directions or features
4. **Document assumptions** - What you're assuming vs. what's confirmed
5. **Make it actionable** - OpusPlan should know exactly what to build for THIS client
6. **Keep it concise** - The best practices doc has the "how", this brief has the "what" and "why"

## Getting Started

**To begin:** 

1. **Prepare client information:**
   - Company name and current website URL
   - Initial project description (what you know so far)
   - Service area (cities/regions they serve)
   - Any existing review platforms (Google, Facebook, etc.)

2. **Fill in the [Client Information] section** above with what you know

3. **Paste this entire prompt into your chat with Sonnet**
   - Sonnet will research the current website(s)
   - Sonnet will analyze service area and competition
   - Sonnet will begin Round 1 with 20 targeted questions

4. **Answer each round thoughtfully:**
   - Round 1: Foundation (business, audience, market, current state)
   - Round 2: Design & Experience (visual preferences, user journey, content needs)
   - Round 3: Priorities & Scope (features, integrations, timeline, success metrics)

5. **Review the generated `opusplan_project_brief.txt` file:**
   - Verify all client-specific information is captured
   - Confirm it focuses on "what to build" not "how to build"
   - Ensure design preferences and conversion goals are clear
   - Validate feature priorities align with client operations

6. **Provide to OpusPlan along with best practices doc:**
   - Save brief in project repository
   - Ensure best practices doc is accessible at `/mnt/user-data/uploads/web_dev_best_practices_comprehensive.md`
   - Start Claude Code with `claude --model opusplan`
   - Provide the brief
   - OpusPlan will read both documents and create comprehensive technical plan

7. **Track your time:**
   - Discovery session: ~1 hour (this process)
   - Planning: ~1 hour (OpusPlan GitHub issue creation)
   - Implementation: 4-6 hours (AI-assisted build)
   - Revisions: 1-2 hours (client feedback)
   - Target: 8-10 hours total for standard projects

**The Workflow:**
```
Discovery (You + Client) 
  → Sonnet Brainstorm Prompt
  → 60 Questions + Answers
  → opusplan_project_brief.txt

Planning (OpusPlan) 
  → Reads: project_brief.txt + web_dev_best_practices.md
  → Creates: Technical plan in GitHub issue
  → Switches to: Sonnet for implementation

Building (Sonnet) 
  → Follows: Technical plan
  → References: Best practices for patterns
  → Delivers: Production-ready website
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Have client's Google Business Profile ready for review count
- Ask for existing content/images early to avoid delays  
- Clarify booking system expectations upfront (link vs integration)
- Set clear milestone approvals to prevent revision creep
- The best practices doc handles the "how", focus on capturing the "what" and "why" for this specific client

Let's create something exceptional! 🚀
